A collection of **custom, compliant userscripts** for [Torn](https://www.torn.com/)  
designed to enhance gameplay quality-of-life **without breaking the Torn API Terms of Service**.

All scripts are built for **Tampermonkey** (desktop & mobile) and **Torn PDA**,  
using read-only API access and safe DOM enhancements.

## ‚úÖ Compliance & Fair Use

These scripts are designed with **Torn‚Äôs Terms of Service** and **scripting rules** in mind:

- **No automated gameplay actions** ‚Äî scripts never perform clicks or send game actions for you.
- **Read-only API usage** ‚Äî only allowed API endpoints are used (e.g., `user‚Üíprofile`).
- **DOM enhancements only** ‚Äî scripts may rearrange, highlight, or pre-fill game UI, but you must confirm actions manually.
- **No botting** ‚Äî scripts are not bots and cannot be used to gain unfair gameplay advantages.
- **No commercial use** ‚Äî provided free and open source.
- **No affiliation** ‚Äî not associated with Torn or its developers.
- **Not a replacement for official features** ‚Äî supplements gameplay with quality-of-life improvements only.
- **Local storage only** ‚Äî settings are saved in `localStorage`/`sessionStorage`; nothing is transmitted externally.
- **API key safety** ‚Äî any API key is stored locally and never shared. Users are responsible for managing their own keys.
- **Purpose** ‚Äî built purely for in-game convenience, monitoring, and notifications.

## üìú Overview

These scripts aim to:
- Automate **monitoring** and **notifications** for in-game events (e.g., leaving hospital).
- **Navigate** or prepare game pages automatically (no auto-clicking game actions).
- Provide **visual aids** and **status indicators**.
- Always stay within Torn‚Äôs scripting and API rules.
